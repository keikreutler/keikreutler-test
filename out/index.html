		<p>The unMonastery is a social clinic for the future.  It is a meeting place for the suspicious.  It is of deep concern. The unMonastery repeatedly fails to define itself in anything other than its real time work.  It is urgently important that it succeed.</p>

		<p><p>“When it comes to work it is increasingly difficult to reconcile making money with making sense. People do work to make a living. Others do work to make meaning. But the two works are not the same work.”</p>
</p>
<div>
    <h3 class="animated">The Idea</h3>
    <div class="hide-desc">
        <p>We accept at this point in history that retreat is as legitimate as growth; that models of collective effort indicate a path of optimal low-consumption human deployment; that a synthesis of urban and regional survival strategies might provide a platform for future life; that &#39;frugal abundance&#39; can be an attractive strategic goal that provides significant emotional satisfaction.</p>
<p>The unMonastery proposal is to amplify this emotional satisfaction through evolving cultural life forms that promote valuable social spin-offs.  The key is hard work.</p>
<p>The unMonastery is an infrastructure space which allows people and groups on the fringes of society, who normally have no common interface ─ citizens of small towns on the periphery of Europe; nomadic web developers), to interact and work together to address concerns both on the local and global scale. Combining existing resources ─ unused buildings; idealistic, highly educated, skilled people who are reluctant or unable to join the job market; open source culture; design patterns for sustainable living ─ the unMonastery addresses diverse contemporary issues such as depletion of skilled workforce in remote areas, youth unemployment, social cohesion, the attrition caused by automation, and sustainable development.</p>

    </div>
</div>
<div>
    <h3 class="animated">The Place</h3>
    <div class="hide-desc">
        <p>The unMonastery is not a building nor its inhabitants.  The unMonastery is the role it acquires through collaboration with its host community. It is based upon a contract offering unused resources (a building) in exchange for a residency of the best people we can recruit who are willing to adopt a lifestyle of service. </p>
<p>It is based upon an act of faith: faith that the inherent wisdom of the model will inspire good works.  The Art of unMonasticism is to render our work clear, relevant and in tune with local aspirations.  It is essential that these aspirations accurately reflect realistic expectations.</p>
<p>It also happens that the unMonastery is in fact a building ─ usually a temporary, possibly long-term location for a group of unMonasterians. It consists of living quarters: shared bedrooms, bathrooms, a library; and community spaces: a kitchen, areas for working and gathering. The community spaces are open to anyone while the building is open. </p>
<p>There is a daily cooking schedule, designated residents and friends preparing meals for everyone. Cleaning is done together; shopping, garbage and other chores are distributed. The unMonastery is modestly but functionally furnished with furniture and objects which are preferably reused, follow open source instructions or are made of recycled materials. Energy and water consumption and waste production are monitored and published monthly or in real time. The unMonastery strives to be a safe-space.</p>

    </div>
</div>
<div>
    <h3 class="animated">The People</h3>
    <div class="hide-desc">
        <p>In addition, the unMonastery is also its people. A highly diverse network of social innovators, hackers, software developers, artists, engineers, writers, farmers, designers, architects, gamers and activists working together with their local equivalent to develop practical, tangible projects strategically designed to feed both their local and global communities. </p>
<p>Along the chain of action points from the initial invitation from a community and the vetting of its suitability as a future location─to the first opening of the unMonastic doors, any number of concerned citizens may attach themselves to greater or lesser degrees. All of these can be considered Stakeholders; some will insist on joining us in getting their hands dirty.  </p>
<p><em>What could be your contribution?  What are the requirements for hosting or joining an unMonastery?   How is this a key investment in improving humankind’s survival potential?</em></p>
<p>This Handbook is designed to indicate what we consider to be the most reasonable response to these and other questions.</p>

    </div>
</div>
<div>
    <h3 class="animated">The Work</h3>
    <div class="hide-desc">
        <p>The unMonastery is an attempt to integrate work that provides food and shelter, with work that is meaningful both on a local and global scale. (Please see The Book of Greater and Lesser Omissions: The Work.)</p>

    </div>
</div>
<div>
    <h3 class="animated">The Culture</h3>
    <div class="hide-desc">
        <p>The unMonastery is a technologically savvy community that seeks to emulate certain aspects of medieval monasticism. Excluding prescriptive religion, hierarchy and gender separation, unMonasterians aim to combine commitment to working on both local and global ─ or universal ─ issues. </p>
<p>They live a more rounded and healthier life than the urban existence they leave behind; they respect each other, the place, the people, cultural and personal difference. They share their skills and learn new ones.  </p>
<p>We remain deeply curious as to how this loving, generous, and conscious society can evolve and still avoid the traps of becoming a cult. </p>

    </div>
</div>
<div>
    <h3 class="animated">The Equipment</h3>
    <div class="hide-desc">
        <p>The word “equipe” comes from French, meaning team. The unMonastery equipment consists of its people: those physically present in the building, their global network and the local community. To align and nurture this community, we have developed the key tools of: V.A.V. (visceral added value) unCivilisation Readjustment Therapy and I Progettini.</p>
<p>Visceral Added Value indicates the need to render each action into an exchange that is tactile and measurable in human terms.  It can quickly become imperative that each project be strategically aligned to emphasise its value in a manner that clearly communicates its virtue.  To do so, it is wise to break down often mammoth individual projects into their component, more measurable daily ‘progettini’.</p>
<p>‘unCivilization Readjustment Therapy’ is how we generate team spirit and come closer to better elucidating The ‘We’. (Please see:  The Book of Greater and lesser Omissions: The ‘We’.)</p>
<p>In order to preserve our experiences and create value even of our first floundering steps of the Matera prototype, we developed our great documentation tool, The Book of Greater and Lesser Omissions.  In order to provide an overview of the unMonastery idea and develop a tool to involve people and implement new ideas in the unMonastery, we developed the unMonastery BIOS.</p>

<p>MAZI means “together” in Greek. The MAZI initiative is a Horizon2020 project to develop a toolkit for building local, community wireless networks. The main goal is to create spaces, “MAZI Zones,” that can empower those living in physical proximity to shape their space together. As a pilot in the consortium, the unMonastery’s task becomes to modulate participation, local knowledge, and conviviality according to the specificities of local environments. </p>

<p>The unMonastery is a strange beast — manifesting itself through conversations, small gatherings, a full blown prototype, scoping exercises and conference presentations. It has found itself with a constantly fluctuating level of supporters, participants and dedicated unMonasterians. Like shifting tectonic plates, opportunity for critical convergence often leads to large volcanoes of activity, which dissipate and move on over time. For ways to connect with a project that has a constantly shifting centre of gravity, please participate in any of our various communication channels.</p>
