            <h2 id="waking-the-unmonastery-organ">Waking The unMonastery Organ</h2>
<p>Back in February of 2015, we hosted the first <a href="https://transmediale.de/content/the-first-global-unmonastery-summit">unMonastery unSummit in Berlin</a> as part of Transmediale: Capture All, at which the majority of the core group were gathered. As part of this gathering we held a series of meetings and events, in which together we sought to identify what was essential to the ongoing development of unMonastery.</p>
<p>One of the central requirements identified during our circles, was the need to form an autonomous legal organ in order to establish clearer structures and models for participation, acknowledge the vast mix of contributions being made by individuals to unMonastery over time, decentralise tacit control within an accountable structure, and advance opportunities for resources to support the establishment of individual unMonastery nodes. This was particularly crucial given that over the past year the initiative and network had grown far beyond its early stage development within the EdgeRyders community.vcxvx</p>
<p>During this meeting we hit upon an organisational model that we felt was both open and inclusive. Whilst light as a foundational starting point, the key invention for this was that membership can be claimed by all those who commit significant energy and <em>time</em> to the development of unMonastery. Thus The unMonastery Deep Time Bank was born.</p>
<h2 id="the-unmonastery-deep-time-bank">The unMonastery Deep Time Bank</h2>
<p>As a decentralised membership steered organisation, we needed a criteria for inclusion. We settled upon a membership ‘fee’ of 100 hours of unpaid unMonastery labour as the marker for meaningful commitment, and─we sent out an invite to all those that had contributed this level of time to the initiative up until then. We then got deliciously sidetracked by field level developments in Athens. Now, finally back on track, this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mvgS5RObf29Htfubh0fY_s7aVkFL1mQb70jNvztuF44/edit?usp=sharing">organisational document</a> should outline how we anticipate the organisational structure will work in practice as both a membership base, organisation forum and commitment management account. We are very <a href="https://medium.com/@unmonastery/unmonastery-the-year-ahead-2f082b000a7a#.bb8gvjvnz">happy to announce the composition</a> of this new organisation of intrepid souls committed to the continuation of the unMonastery initiative.</p>
<p>If at this stage you would like to participate to a greater degree, or have been working in isolation on unMonastery related activity let us know at <a href="mailto:admin@unmonastery.org">admin@unmonastery.org</a>, and time permitting be sworn into the unOrder at the next annual general meeting.</p>
<p>If the model we’ve established is of interest to you and you’d like to help us to refine it further, use it for your own organisation or assist in the development of a complementary technology stack, drop into <a href="http://discourse.unmonastery.org/t/examining-the-unmonastery-deep-time-bank/107">this thread</a> on Discourse.</p>

<li><p>The unMonastery annual gatherings are referred to in the <a href="bios-v1/scriptorium_25_5_16.pdf">Almanac</a>. These gatherings are scheduled according to Lunar Cycles and are scheduled decades in advanced. There are four each year which align with the seasons <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_pIJ9BjESb4Hd5IHOmiLepVxNKFWDvAXjgDrYwz7plw/edit#gid=0">(the full calendar)</a>. At each of these gatherings an effort is made to collate all of the tasks that are relevant to the development of the organisation and where energy should be placed for each cycle going forward. </p>
</li>
<li><p>These tasks are compiled and posted to Loomio, then in turn fleshed out and prioritised, with a poll to reach agreement on the compilation and the suggested timeframe. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Tasks from this list are then set in stone as the priority for the organisation and should act as the first port of call for anyone wishing to contribute to the Deep Time Bank. Tasks can be picked up by individuals or groups; we aim to complete each list of tasks within the given cycle, though this can be ambitious. If any tasks remain they are carried over to the next cycle. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Upon completion of tasks, it is advisable that each individual register their time in the log file, using the submission form. Anyone at any time can view all of the tasks that have been submitted in the spreadsheet.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In order for each task to be accepted as a contribution of time, 2 other individuals from unMonastery Metanational are randomly selected to countersign and authenticate that the work logged has been completed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>At each gathering the log file is reviewed, so to inform ongoing activity, identify where support may be beneficial and to celebrate the achievements of individuals and groups that have submitted significant time and energy to the mission. </p>
</li>
<li><p>In instances where a 100 hours have not been submitted within a year those members are deregistered from the membership.</p>
</li>
