The unMonastery is not a building nor its inhabitants.  The unMonastery is the role it acquires through collaboration with its host community. It is based upon a contract offering unused resources (a building) in exchange for a residency of the best people we can recruit who are willing to adopt a lifestyle of service. 

It is based upon an act of faith: faith that the inherent wisdom of the model will inspire good works.  The Art of unMonasticism is to render our work clear, relevant and in tune with local aspirations.  It is essential that these aspirations accurately reflect realistic expectations.
   
It also happens that the unMonastery is in fact a building â”€ usually a temporary, possibly long-term location for a group of unMonasterians. It consists of living quarters: shared bedrooms, bathrooms, a library; and community spaces: a kitchen, areas for working and gathering. The community spaces are open to anyone while the building is open. 

There is a daily cooking schedule, designated residents and friends preparing meals for everyone. Cleaning is done together; shopping, garbage and other chores are distributed. The unMonastery is modestly but functionally furnished with furniture and objects which are preferably reused, follow open source instructions or are made of recycled materials. Energy and water consumption and waste production are monitored and published monthly or in real time. The unMonastery strives to be a safe-space.
