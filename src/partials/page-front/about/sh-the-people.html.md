In addition, the unMonastery is also its people. A highly diverse network of social innovators, hackers, software developers, artists, engineers, writers, farmers, designers, architects, gamers and activists working together with their local equivalent to develop practical, tangible projects strategically designed to feed both their local and global communities. 

Along the chain of action points from the initial invitation from a community and the vetting of its suitability as a future location─to the first opening of the unMonastic doors, any number of concerned citizens may attach themselves to greater or lesser degrees. All of these can be considered Stakeholders; some will insist on joining us in getting their hands dirty.  

*What could be your contribution?  What are the requirements for hosting or joining an unMonastery?   How is this a key investment in improving humankind’s survival potential?*

This Handbook is designed to indicate what we consider to be the most reasonable response to these and other questions.
