## Local Wireless Networks ##


MAZI means “together” in Greek. The MAZI initiative is a Horizon2020 project to develop a toolkit for building local, community wireless networks.

As a pilot in the consortium, the unMonastery’s task becomes to modulate participation, local knowledge, and conviviality according to the specificities of local environments.
