# Ways of Communicating #

The unMonastery is a strange beast — manifesting itself through conversations, small gatherings, a full blown prototype, scoping exercises and conference presentations. It has found itself with a constantly fluctuating level of supporters, participants and dedicated unMonasterians. Like shifting tectonic plates, opportunity for critical convergence often leads to large volcanoes of activity, which dissipate and move on over time. For ways to connect with a project that has a constantly shifting centre of gravity, please participate in any of our various communication channels.

See our [Expression of Interest](/participate) form to embark toward the cave entrance.
