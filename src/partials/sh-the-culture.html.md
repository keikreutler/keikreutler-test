The unMonastery is a technologically savvy community that seeks to emulate certain aspects of medieval monasticism. Excluding prescriptive religion, hierarchy and gender separation, unMonasterians aim to combine commitment to working on both local and global (or universal) issues. 

They live a more rounded and healthier life than the urban existence they leave behind; they respect each other, the place, the people, cultural and personal difference; they share their skills and learn new ones.  

We remain deeply curious as to how this loving, generous, and conscious society can evolve and still avoid the traps of becoming a cult.
