#### unMonastery Card Set ####

Designed in collaboration with [MethodKit](http://methodkit.com), this acts as a checklist to help both established and beginning unMonasterians work together, nurture ideas, and get an overview of common questions.  Depending on methodology the cards can be deployed as both an evaluation tool and a recruitment aid.
