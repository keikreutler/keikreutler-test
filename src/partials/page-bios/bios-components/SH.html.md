#### Stakeholders Handbook ####

The unMonastery is no clandestine operation, it aspires to involve as many people in the process as is organisationally possible.  As a result of this aspiration, negotiation between individuals and groups can feel like a minefield - the Stakeholders Handbook is designed to help orientate and coach future unMonasterians and their rings of attendant Stakeholders in managing their relationships.
