## Waking The unMonastery Organ ##

xxxBack in February of 2015, we hosted the first [unMonastery unSummit in Berlin](https://transmediale.de/content/the-first-global-unmonastery-summit) as part of Transmediale: Capture All, at which the majority of the core group were gathered. As part of this gathering we held a series of meetings and events, in which together we sought to identify what was essential to the ongoing development of unMonastery.

One of the central requirements identified during our circles, was the need to form an autonomous legal organ in order to establish clearer structures and models for participation, acknowledge the vast mix of contributions being made by individuals to unMonastery over time, decentralise tacit control within an accountable structure, and advance opportunities for resources to support the establishment of individual unMonastery nodes. This was particularly crucial given that over the past year the initiative and network had grown far beyond its early stage development within the EdgeRyders community.vcxvx

During this meeting we hit upon an organisational model that we felt was both open and inclusive. Whilst light as a foundational starting point, the key invention for this was that membership can be claimed by all those who commit significant energy and *time* to the development of unMonastery. Thus The unMonastery Deep Time Bank was born.


## The unMonastery Deep Time Bank ##

As a decentralised membership steered organisation, we needed a criteria for inclusion. We settled upon a membership ‘fee’ of 100 hours of unpaid unMonastery labour as the marker for meaningful commitment, and─we sent out an invite to all those that had contributed this level of time to the initiative up until then. We then got deliciously sidetracked by field level developments in Athens. Now, finally back on track, this [organisational document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mvgS5RObf29Htfubh0fY_s7aVkFL1mQb70jNvztuF44/edit?usp=sharing) should outline how we anticipate the organisational structure will work in practice as both a membership base, organisation forum and commitment management account. We are very [happy to announce the composition](https://medium.com/@unmonastery/unmonastery-the-year-ahead-2f082b000a7a#.bb8gvjvnz) of this new organisation of intrepid souls committed to the continuation of the unMonastery initiative.

If at this stage you would like to participate to a greater degree, or have been working in isolation on unMonastery related activity let us know at <a href="mailto:admin@unmonastery.org">admin@unmonastery.org</a>, and time permitting be sworn into the unOrder at the next annual general meeting.

If the model we’ve established is of interest to you and you’d like to help us to refine it further, use it for your own organisation or assist in the development of a complementary technology stack, drop into [this thread](http://discourse.unmonastery.org/t/examining-the-unmonastery-deep-time-bank/107) on Discourse.
