A toolkit for starting new unMonasteries and evaluating projects throughout their development, designed on the principle that all knowledge generated by the unMonastery should always open to all, easily accessible and applicable to other initiatives. The unMonastery Bios encompasses the entire knowledge base generated as a result of the 6 month prototype in Matera, Italy during 2014 and is continually updated with further development work.
