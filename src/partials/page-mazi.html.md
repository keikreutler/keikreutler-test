MAZI means “together” in Greek.

The MAZI project is a Horizon2020-funded initiative to develop a toolkit for building local, community wireless networks. The main goal is to create spaces, “MAZI Zones,” that can empower those living in physical proximity to shape their space together. 


Amidst global threats to an open, public internet, the MAZI project seeks to cultivate both temporary and long-term uses of alternative networks in local areas. This Do-It-Yourself approach combines low-cost hardware and free/libre/open source software (FLOSS) applications for affordability and accessibility, encouraging communities to run their own network infrastructure.

The MAZI consortium consists of four partners and four pilot projects, which over the course of the 2-year project will experiment with the creation of MAZI Zones in their specific localities, working within and beyond their communities to encourage participation in public spaces. The unMonastery is one of these pilots, joined by a wonderful crew from [CreekNet](http://www.mazizone.eu/pilot-studies/creeknet/), Deptford’s network of local communities, [Kraftwerk1 & NeNa1](http://www.mazizone.eu/pilot-studies/kraftwerk1-nena1/), Zurich’s cooperative housing and living projects, and [Prinzessinnengarten](http://www.mazizone.eu/pilot-studies/prinzessinnengarten/), Berlin’s urban garden and the Neighborhood Academy.


As a pilot in the consortium, the unMonastery’s task becomes to modulate participation, local knowledge, and conviviality according to the specificities of local environments. Early participation in the consortium produced a [massive spill of ideas and speculations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IO2vhTn5IUEM_tXcD4sa7Yjm5PenjF2qcadXzkRnDIw/edit?usp=sharing) from the unMonks, ranging from an ambient, Raspberry-pi presence guiding daily routine to a storage site for local knowledge and [Mapping the Commons](http://mappingthecommons.org) re-invigorations.


Inspired by the Sarantaporo region’s [community-built and -owned wireless network](http://www.sarantaporo.gr/), the possibility for a new unMonastery in Kokkinopilos came to view in 2016. On the western slopes of Mount Olympus in a former school building, the unMonastery summer gathering was located in just such a place, in order to explore a concrete platform for widening the concepts and structure for a potential pilot site in close collaboration with neighbors, fellow travelers and surrounding organisations.


Our pilot is set to launch in the spring of 2017.
