*“When it comes to work it is increasingly difficult to reconcile making money with making sense. People do work to make a living. Others do work to make meaning. But the two works are not the same work.”*

The unMonastery is an attempt to integrate work that provides food and shelter, with work that is meaningful both on a local and global scale. (Please see The Book of Greater and Lesser Omissions: The Work).
