We accept at this point in history that retreat is as legitimate as growth; that models of collective effort indicate a path of optimal low-consumption human deployment; that a synthesis of urban and regional survival strategies might provide a platform for future life; that 'frugal abundance' can be an attractive strategic goal that provides significant emotional satisfaction.

The unMonastery proposal is to amplify this emotional satisfaction through evolving cultural life forms that promote valuable social spin-offs.  The key is hard work.

The unMonastery is an infrastructure space which allows people and groups on the fringes of society, who normally have no common interface (citizens of small towns on the periphery of Europe; nomadic web developers), to interact and work together to address concerns both on the local and global scale. Combining existing resources (unused buildings; idealistic, highly educated, skilled people who are reluctant or unable to join the job market; open source culture; design patterns for sustainable living) the unMonastery addresses diverse contemporary issues such as depletion of skilled workforce in remote areas, youth unemployment, social cohesion, the attrition caused by automation, and sustainable development.
